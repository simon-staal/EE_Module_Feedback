# EIE 3<sup>rd</sup> Year Modules <!-- omit in toc -->
This document is a comprehensive guide aiming to make it easier for EIE (and EEE) students to choose their modules for 3<sup>rd</sup> year. Additional information on modules can be found by looking at SOLE survey results (see [here](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/student-surveys/ug-student-surveys/ug-sole/ug-sole-results/)), although if you're looking for a more *unfiltered* view then you're probably in the right place. For modules shared between EEE and EIE, reviews are marked EEE or EIE (and if left blank are unknown).

This document is maintained by the EIE departmental representative, instructions to maintain can be found [here](https://github.com/sts219/EE_Module_Feedback). If you'd like to add feedback, please submit it [here](https://forms.office.com/r/B8bkf2pGsE) **(Please check that the year of the survey matches your current academic year, and if it doesn't contact your dep rep!)**

# General Advice
## 2021/22
3rd year is a lot of work, more than 2nd year in my opinion. However, I took an extra (DoC) module, which definitely amped up my workload - DO NOT DO THIS, IT'S A DISADVANTAGE GRADES WISE (unless you really want to, feel free to ask me about it). You have 7 actual modules (at least 3 EE and 2 DoC) + 1 horizons module (which may or may not be significant work depending on which one you got). Having tried 4 'real' modules in both Autumn and Spring (not counting my Horizons module which was 0 effort - Project Management bless up :pray:), I would 100% recommend taking 4 in Autumn (and 3 in Spring), the EE CW in spring is a huge time sink if you're looking to get high marks. Combining that with revising for DoC exams at the end of term makes 4 module Spring even worse than 2nd year term 2. With that in mind, 4 modules in Autumn term is still tough, and you might feel overwhelmed at times (I certainly did). If you're worried about the workload, get your applications for 6 month placements done AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Depending on what you're looking for, you'll be spending a significant number of hours a week doing applications, online assessments and interviews. If you can get it done in the first month of term (or even before term starts), you'll have a lot more time to focus on your modules. That said, take the time to try and get something you want, getting a good placement is more important than your modules (EDIT: On my placement now, no regrets, was completely worth it). 

Overall, you have the opportunity to focus into modules you're really interested in in 3rd year. Take the time to consider what fields you want to work in as a graduate, and what modules help you get there. Despite it being more work, I found the work a lot more interesting, since I was doing modules I actually cared about. Good luck :smile: - Simon


Think twice before you choose the modules. It would be a hard time if you choose a mix of
both eee and doc modules in spring term, as both the exams and deadlines for the coursework
would be in the same week and you need to spend the revision time doing coursework when the DoC
students are preparing for the exams. – S

## 2020/21
In Spring term I think a good balance is 2 EEE modules and 2 DoC modules (assuming your
split is four modules per term). If you’re doing 3 EEE modules and 1 DoC module... have fun with
coursework lol – JZ


I feel that 3rd year is a time to think about what parts of the course you’re enjoying, and what parts
you want to focus on going ahead. If you enjoy what you do, you’ll find it a lot easier to cope with the work. Spring term is a test of your ability to prioritise, manage time and divide it well between all the different
coursework deadlines that you have. If you want to do well, it will require hard work - Aaman


BPES: Accounting is the closest to a fair-evaluation module (not random marks on your essays) but it’s
the most time-consuming. Placements: you really need to prioritize at the beginning of the year how
much time you are read to spend on interviewing. You’ll get many 1-2 week notice interviews, most of
which last on average 2.5 hours. This will slow your study pace, so make sure you’re on top of things
when possible. - Jaafar

# Industrial Placement / Groupo Project / Individual Projects

Here's a quick summary of some important points:
- Apply to lots of places, expect many rejections
- Track your applications (I used excel, see uploaded template)
- Practice hackerrank / leetcode for coding challenges if you're going into software
- Research the company for non-technical interview prep (what do they do, why do you want to work there, why you'd be a good fit)
- Always ask for feedback from the interviewers
- Start early (before term starts)
- Good luck, try not to get disheartened :)

You're always welcome to ask me for advice :blush: - Simon 2021/22


Ask people in higher years who interned at the companies you’re interested in. They’ll give you interview tips, help you on the CV, tell you exactly what it’s like working at the company as a student interning. Potentially they’ll also refer you in most cases. For software interviews, leetcode is good, but in-person practice is 10 times better in my opinion. Try to get one face-to-face session per week with a friend or someone in a higher year with more technical interview experience. For PM and non-technical interviews, read “Cracking the PM interview”. It provides you with general rules and guidelines and how to structure your answers and guide yourself through the interviewer’s questions. Most recruitment starts in August for tech and trading, start reaching out to recruiters by then. - Jaafar 20/21


Start applying as early as possible – get your CV/LinkedIn/whatever else ready before term starts and then start applying. The earlier you get your placement sorted out the easier your life will be. Also – you'll probably be rejected by most places. If you’re going for a software role, make sure you practice a lot beforehand as well. - JZ, 2020/21


It’s ok to get your application rejected. It happens. And it’s ok if you don’t end up getting a placement. That can also happen. None of this defines you. - Aaman, 2020-21

Be great at one programming language (show dem your projects), have semi-decent grades, demonstrate your communication skills and landing a placement is just an arm-length away. After couple of failures, you would learn what interviewers want to hear and what interviewers don’t want to know about. 2020/21 Z


Advice for aspiring SWE candidates targeting placements at big tech/tech in finance – grind leetcode over summer and apply early. Positions fill up early and are highly competitive as you’ll be competing with DoC students too. Brush up on core CS fundamentals (OS, data structures, algorithms) as these get asked frequently too. Take note of groupwork/previous internship experiences that you can bring up during behavioral interviews and prepare well for these too. - Daryl 20/21


It’s ok if you get rejected like 1000 times. I promise a load of other people are too. Get in the applications early like September/ August. Try to focus on a few companies you really want and spend the summer practising programming or reading over notes etc to prepare. Then start applying to companies you may not have considered. Update your LinkedIn!! You can get recruited off it. Also ask some of the older years. It also helps if you have a spreadsheet of companies to keep organised. Try and focus your applications – I didn’t which was fine in the end but stressful writing a bunch of different field cover letters. Just put yourself out there; don’t hold back on your skills in your CV. Once you do enough applications, you’ll know how to sell yourself so trust the process. If you don’t find anything, the group projects can also get you graduate roles and they’re really fun!! They also help when it comes to graduate applications so either way you don’t “lose”. If you want to go into tech in finance, leetcode and hackerrank are your best friends. Best of Luck !!! - Simi 2020/21


Understand yourself better, what careers you want to pursue, how to represent yourself in CV/Cover letter, compare your current skills set to your desire jobs requirement, find areas to improve. – 2019/20


Start applying early! Oct is a good time to start applying. – 2019/20


Focus on applications - those are more important – 2019/20


Apply to a LOT and don't be disheartened by not getting responses. – Yusuf, 2019/20


Man just get a placement, like start searching at the beginning of the year. Group project is alright but its no replacement for being paid. - 2019/20

Spend all of October and November applying! Best to have an offer before the end of the year, Then you can really chill out in second term. And Get ready for lots of rejections – Kunal, 2019


Go careers fair (if it's not cancelled because of corona), check websites/LinkedIn for applications – Tarik, 2019/20

# Autumn Term
## EEE Modules
Most EEE modules this term are fully exam based, where assessment take place over the last 2 weeks of term. Some modules also have include coursework (worth ~20%, may differ per module).
### Communication Systems
**Imperial Module Page: [here](http://intranet.ee.ic.ac.uk/electricalengineering/eecourses_t4/course_content.asp?c=ELEC60007&s=J3#start)** 

#### 2020/21
Exam is heavily based on the extensive problem sets so get to know them well! It's a very very long and varied course. It really does develop your intuition. Hassle Manikas when you have questions and you will get them answered. Really patient guy. Super passionate about his subject.


Really liked the module all in all, and would recommend to anyone interested in Comms. Personally found the content very demanding, mainly due to the sheer volume. There is a lot of stuff. The exam is comparatively straightforward, and if you do and understand all the problem sheet questions, the exam wont be too bad. If you put in the effort, it will pay off. There is also a coursework element to the module over Christmas on MATLAB, which isn't easy but manageable over the break. Manikas is also very good, explaining content well and also answering questions effectively.

This module is highly recommended to anyone interested in Comms. The content is long and can become difficult to understand in the end. The exam is based on the problem sheet questions, so being able to solve these questions is key to scoring well in the exam. There is also a CW assignment over Christmas, which requires a solid understanding of the second part of the module, which has more demanding concepts. Manikas is a good lecturer, who wants to support students and is willing to answer questions, so it’s definitely worth asking him about concepts you do not understand.

### Digital Signal Processing
**Imperial Module Page: [here](http://intranet.ee.ic.ac.uk/electricalengineering/eecourses_t4/course_content.asp?c=ELEC60010&s=J3#start)**

#### 2020/21
Dr. Stathaki's slides are example rich and the exam draws entirely from the maths demonstrated in the slides. However, it's fair to say that this course is more theoretical and mathematical than in previous years.


The slides are quite detailed and extensive however the pace of the explanations can sometimes be long winded during the lectures however Dr Stathaki is always happy to help and explain anything if you didn't understand it. The modules is quite theoretical but gives you a good basis of DSP however be ready to commit to doing a lot of theoretical maths to be good at this module. The exam was entirely based on the lecture slides with some extension of concepts.


Dr Stathaki’s slides are detailed and contain loads of examples and thorough explanations. The lecturers can be boring because she sometimes devotes too much time to easier concepts, which leads to a slow pace. That said, she always happy to answer questions either in the lecture or via email (she’ll get back to you in 24 hours usually). The exam was quite heavy mathematically, which means you need to practice effectively the math concepts she teaches. You should try to get access to the 2020 exam and to the sample exams she gave us because her style significantly differs from Naylor.

### Control Engineering
**Imperial Module Page: [here](http://intranet.ee.ic.ac.uk/electricalengineering/eecourses_t4/course_content.asp?c=ELEC60008&s=J3#start)**

#### 2021/22
Astolfi is a good lecturer, keeping you engaged in lectures. Lectures are fast-paced but you get used to them, make sure you interrupt for questions if you need to. Astolfi doesn’t reply to questions in email (from my experience at least) and even though I wasn’t in College during exam period and deliberately asked him to help me via email/Teams, he asked me again to come to College, which I didn’t. Ended up answering the questions with friends/after working more on exercises. So make sure if you need help you show up, or pester him, or ask as early as you can, to ensure you get your answers. Resources are primarily the lecture notes (I didn’t use any book or additional resources, and found that notes Astolfi makes during the lecture are much better, and sufficient for the exam, than the actual pre-written lecture notes, which are very mathematical and abstract for no reason in my opinion. So that, along with past papers, should get you ready for exams. Other than that, module is pretty mathematical and the exam is pretty standard (make sure you do most (or all!) of the past papers and you will be legend for the exams). In our case, the exercises at the end of the lecture notes were much harder than the actual exam and the past papers, but still do them to be prepared and avoid any surprise. No coursework for this module, which is good if you want a free Christmas holiday! - Valy (EEE)

#### 2020/21
I agree with the other comments, the examples at the back of the book are brilliant. The book itself feels overwhelming so glance through it every once in a while and definitely use it for revision. There are some things explained in the book not explicitly covered in the lectures but are still examinable. For example: Dead beat controller/observer. Really useful module overall if picked with maths for signals and systems as they both complement each other a lot! You might have a tough time if you don't pick maths.


The book is quite remarkable, but unless you are a comfortable first class student it's very hard going. However, the 30 exercises at the back are brilliant and able practice. This year's exam was exceptionally difficult. Actually, the previous year's was very difficult too. Only take this module if you are ready to commit to it.


The book itself is quite daunting however for the content you definitely need Maths or do it in your ownste time. The exam is quite difficult hence only take it if you are committed to the module. The module is generally quite abstract and theoretical however covers a lot of content. So only take the module if you are ready to commit to it hardcore and actually interested in control.


Most people here tend to read the book, I prefer watching youtube lectures. Here are some useful
channels: John Rossiter, megr438, Matthew Wright,
Jonathan Sprinkle(more about self driving cars with control), MathDoctorBob, MATLAB (for filters), Steve
Brunton (best one).

Great lecturer, I found the combo of (actually) watching his lectures + reading the notes working. If
you like the ‘understanding’ part more than the tons of theoritical knowledge you might like this
course. However if you’re looking for a module where you can just learn stuff by heart maybe pick
another one. - MG

The module was interesting and I enjoyed being able to pretty much learn from the book but I got
wrecked by the exam because I didn’t revise enough. You definitely need to put in the work but the
actual content isn’t too bad. I also had to cram all of maths for signals but it was helpful even for 4th
year stuff😊 - Simi

### Mathematics for Signals and Systems
**Imperial Module Page: [here](http://intranet.ee.ic.ac.uk/electricalengineering/eecourses_t4/course_content.asp?c=ELEC60021&s=J3#start)**

#### 2021/22
The module is not hard and it would be a great choice if you just want to get some good grades. The content is almost repeating.


Pretty standard but pretty neat module, if you are EIE/EEE, your 2nd year Mathematics (Mathematics for Engineers II) module literally has the copied and pasted notes from this module, so overlap is an understatement, this is the linear algebra part of your course copied over word for word, no exaggeration, (SVD, Fundemental Subspaces, Diagonalization, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, etc) so if you banged that out in 2nd year, this one is a good one to take for some guaranteed marks. The exam varies little year on year but this year we had more curveballs probably due to the online-setting. For any topics where you lack understanding use the 2nd year notes it will help more, or use the Gil Strang youtube videos. Although as updated advice for those using the new EE course I whole-heartedly just suggest going over your old notes and lectures from 2nd year because that helped me more than actually attending the lectures did. There is a lot of hidden value in this module though because a lot of the concepts you pick up and refine end up being heavily utilised in optimization, as well as ML (particularly with convolutional neural networks), honestly just take it to fill in one of your mandated EE slots if you’re like me and have a preference for the DoC modules. - Aryan


Nice professor in my opinion. UTAs/GTAs are really useful too on edStem so this module flowed really
well. Yeah as Aryan covered above, most of the content is just the same as that in 2nd Year. - Nelson

#### 2020/21
Get watching those Gil Strang YouTube vids early! That really made all the difference come exam time. There are a lot of shortcuts and tricks with linear algebra. If you try and use the slides alone you will fill a lot more pages and be prone to error.


The lectures don't cover much content compared to any other modules so do practice examples a lot. Hence I also suggest to get a linear algebra book to get more detail and learn the tricks of how to do things. The exam was allright in my opinion covers mostly what has been covered and there are quite a few past exam papers. This module is essential to quite a few others.


Do watch Gil Strang's lectures before the start of the term. He covers the course quite quickly, so it doesn't leave too much room to understand the material. In addition he tend to be more focused on the application of linear algebra, rather then the math. But this is third year, so there is the expectation that your math is pretty good. In sum do yourself a favour and spend two weeks prior to term watching Gil Strangs, so you can understand his lectures. Also for tls(not covered by Gil strangs) you might consider watching this video on youtube: Pillai "Ax= b, Least Squares (LS) & Total Least Squares (TLS)".


As everyone else has probably mentioned, start watching Gilbert Strang’s lecturers before the start of term and get the textbook (borrow it from the library- it has at least 10 copies). Dragotti’s slides do not help you pick up the techniques you need to solve linear algebra problems, because they focus more on applications. The way to do well is to study the techniques on your own using GIlbert’s resources, or anything else you may find useful, and then go over Dragotti’s slides to check understanding and learn how to tackle more application-oriented problems. Dragotti is quite happy to answer questions, so it is worth asking him if you’re stuck with anything.

### Artificial Intelligence
**Imperial Module Page: [here](http://intranet.ee.ic.ac.uk/electricalengineering/eecourses_t4/course_content.asp?c=ELEC60004&s=J3#start)**

#### 2021/22
Where to start? There are definitely some parts of this module that are useful, such as learning Prolog and different search algorithms. That’s pretty much where the good stuff ends. Most of your time will be spent learning about and manipulating logic. The exam was heavily based around Calculus KE – Google it and you won’t find anything on it, and the lecturer himself couldn’t even remember what KE stands for. Most of the content is just so incredibly niche, and the exam so time pressured, that I would really be hesitant to recommend this module. If you are really looking to get into AI/ML, there are better
modules to take, as others have mentioned.


This is a good module, however incredibly badly named. It has more to do with declarative programming, logic & search/optimisation algorithms than “artificial intelligence” as such – I would recommend it as the content was engaging, course materials were good & the U/GTAs were helpful, but make sure you look at
the materials before you choose it if you can.


In my opinion this was a very bad module. The course is very unstructured and there’s not much resources to go off of. In exams you get unnecessarily punished not for pointless things that DO NOT reflect how much you actually know about the content (e.g., making the answer of a question 80 lines/ 3 pages long and if you make a little mistake anywhere in those 80 lines you lose marks only for a small number of marks). I have spent most of my hours trying to contact the lecturer on very unclear topics that he has not properly explained in his lectures or written well about in the slides and sometimes get no response. The tutorials he provides are not complete and you will spend loads of hours doing these tutorials when it is worth a very small amount in the actual exam. You CANNOT do the exam without doing ALOT of past papers because most of the exam are not inside the tutorials. I will promise you it is *NOT* worth it.


In my opinion, I would say that this module’s displayed commitment time is highly unrepresentative of the actual time needed to be ‘good’ at this module. A lot of emphasis is placed on labs and tutorials to develop a finer understanding in AI, but ultimately it’s all for nothing because nothing of ultimate relavance was included in the final exam, there was no ‘coursework’ contribution or at least some sort of safety net to compensate for the work we put in, the exam itself included a lot of questions which are super beefed versions of tutorial questions (of which we got the solutions very late for), and lab questions (of which were rather unorganized), coincidentally, one of the larger logic questions in the exam was a specific niche corner of an already rather niche part of the course (iykyk), which was not only barely touched in the lectures except for one pass, but apparently the solution for an associated problem of this type was not even provided, this was also never seen on years of past papers. I spent several pages trying to do one subquestion from that exam, and spent an hour of my time just in doing that almost. The biggest chunk of the logic half of that course has 2 (two) major resources, one being the Professor plugging his own research paper, which is indecipherable on its own, and the other being a rather obscure PDF from an academic who coincidentally was a former student/colleague of the professor, this however constituted 50% of the exam though, which we had barely any prep to study for, and the time I spent which could’ve better been spent on my DoC modules. In my opinion like the above answers postulate, if you want to take a module to get into this area of learning, just do DoC/EE ML and Maths to make your life easier rather than spending time trying to figure out whether you were meant to branch on line 39 of your KE tree or not (and I highly doubt you’ll be asked in a FAANG interview about existential qualifiers, but maybe that’s just me).


#### 2020/21
I personally found the lecturer Jeremy Pitt to be brilliant at making the material engaging and helpful in any issues people had. The content is enjoyable to work through. The tutorials do not fully cover the knowledge needed for the exam but are very useful to do alongside past years papers. Unlike some modules, a genuine understanding of the course is needed for the exam specifically with things relating to
Prolog.

### Communication Networks
**Imperial Module Page: [here](http://intranet.ee.ic.ac.uk/electricalengineering/eecourses_t4/course_content.asp?c=ELEC60006&s=J3#start)**

#### 2021/22
Module is very interesting in terms of communication protocols, internet networks and systems if you want to get into that (also many jobs appreciate having some knowledge into comms, especially in satellite or energy systems). It’s not particularly hard, I find Barria pretty standard, not particularly exciting, but does cover all the material you need to know. He is approachable for questions, answers emails and you can very easily interrupt him during the lectures – he engages a lot in conversations and questions, and you felt you could ask him whatever. He follows the notes, but expands sometimes, and with a good revision over all the exercises you will be alright. Some friends used the book to understand better, but I found asking questions during the lectures were alright for the exam. The exam was as expected, practice the past papers as in every module, revise the lecture notes (if exam remote you don’t have to memorise them, just understand them I would say), and you
will be fine for the exam. -Valy (EEE)


I enjoyed the module although I agree that the notes and teaching are not the best. As an EEE student, I didn’t really know anything about networks, OSI etc. but the content wasn’t intimidating so I ended up becoming really interested in this area. The recommended textbooks are a really good and interesting introduction to comms networks although they are not that helpful for the exam, so make sure you really understand the slides and past papers well (a lot of memorisation). Barria is friendly and happy to answer questions, but his explanations can be chaotic. -Kasia (EEE)


There are loads of contents to remember, even it is an open book exam. Choose it if you are really
interested in communication protocols and networks. Though the grade is not that bad, it will cost more
energy than other modules. And some of the content is a bit confusing, as well as the answers, don’t
hesitate to ask question during lectures or through email.

#### 2020/21
I personally found the notes and slides provided very poor and the lecturer didn't hold my attention well. Any slide can come up in the exam even if brushed over in 30 seconds of a lecture. That said, the exam is very basic and can be done easily if you know the material well.


Agree with most above, Barria is nice but bad at teaching. He just reads his notes and you can do just as well not attending lectures and learning all his slides. It’s a shame because OSI is such an interesting module. For EIE students who took Comms with DoC in 2nd year it might be worth it, less content to learn. - MG

### Machine Learning (EE)
**Imperial Module Page: [here](http://intranet.ee.ic.ac.uk/electricalengineering/eecourses_t4/course_content.asp?c=ELEC60019&s=J3#start)**

**This module is required to take [deep learning](#deep-learning) in spring**

#### 2021/22
First 5 weeks of lecture slides are hell to go through and understand thoroughly. Referring to the Caltech lectures and the book really helped though. The CW is a mix of Colab tasks and a past paper which is actually the exam paper of the previous year; the marking distribution is a bit weird though because most of the marks (~80%) come from the past paper so don’t spend too long making your lab results perfect, just make sure you have a solid understanding of what’s going on. Overall, every paper has a similar format with similar questions:
- Q1 – Modelling a ML problem, 
- Q2 – Neural Networks or Learning algorithms, 
- Q3 – SVMs, 
- Q4 – Clustering or NN classification (but this is me recalling from memory so take it with a grain of salt). 
Overall, despite how poor in my opinion the module was and how difficult it was to get through the lecturer’s content, it ended up being my favourite module from Autumn and what I found most interesting; would gladly take it again. -Nelson


#### 2020/21
Watch the Caltech lectures, they help a lot! The exam this year was quite challenging, but the module is interesting. I won't say it is taught in the best way possible and a lot of times, solutions given can be wrong, but this module has improved over previous years and hopefully it will improve even more. The phrasing of questions in exams is very weird sometimes and there is a chance you might not understand it. Overall, due to the lack of practice material, I will say this was one of my most underprepared exams!


Read through the Caltech lectures or any ML learning groups. Being remote asynchronous this term watching lectures on you own time with not the best explanations. The lecture does seem to be improved compared to the last years lectures. Get your linear algebra together because it will really help your understanding. The exam had weird phrasing and only having 2 past papers and some other examples which are not representative in terms of what they ask is though. The module content is interesting though. Get your report writing skills together because it takes long to type it into overleaf.


Caltech lectures will cover about 80% of the course (watch it before the term starts), they have started adding new content, good for the long run not for the exams. Again, here are some resources. Recomended channels: Ahmet Sacan, statquest(best), Victor Lavrenko, Naveen Kumar. Also, you don't really need to learn python, Matlab is good enough. Coursework requires minimal coding, you only need it to run routines so you can plot graphs, else you will need to do it by hand.


Cannot recommend the Caltech lectures enough, Abu-Mostafa is excellent at explaining content in an understandable way. The same cannot be said for the Imperial lecturers, though they do try. Course is mathematically very rigorous (doing Maths course will help), and to my disappointment there is essentially no practical element (very little coding) to it. The exam is also quite tough, more so due to the vagueness of the questions and the phrasing rather than the actual solution itself. Coursework is useful for the exam, for our year it was essentially the 2019 paper.


I’d say if you want to do well in this module, you cannot rely on lectures/lecture notes alone. The module is centred around ML theory and the maths behind it. It takes some effort to understand the topics discussed in the lectures. In the end, you need to figure out what additional resources work for you to help you understand. I found the Caltech lectures intriguing (although not adequately covering certain topics), as well as online articles (just googling specific ML topics). The GTA hours
and the forum were a great help too. - Aaman


Did not go to a single lecture and was absolutely fine. I read the book and the extension to it. Oh wait I’ll attach it. http://amlbook.com/ which is the learning from data book. If you read that and some of the ebook chapters on the website, you’ll be fine. He even has video lectures (Caltech I think). It is quite maths and theory involved. Always great to look for other sources online no matter what module you’re taking. Very good and useful module for the CV – Simi


## DoC Modules
Things to know about DoC modules:
- DoC modules are typically 20% coursework based 80% exam based. Exams take place on the last week of term, and are predeeded by week where no new material can be taught (no lectures last 2 weeks of term).
- They do not release past paper solutions. There are instead crowd-sourced solutions which can be found [here](https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/comparn_ic_ac_uk/Documents/DoC%20Secret%20Revision%20Folder?csf=1&web=1&e=wFa3K0)
- Some courses will assume you have knowledge which you might be missing (e.g. Operating Systems). A 4th year DoC student Eugene has a repository of rendered LaTeX notes, which are really useful in covering some of this content, which you can find [here](https://github.com/lin-e/imperial-revision).
- You can find seperate DoC module feedback [here](https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/comparn_ic_ac_uk/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BDB61C285-547E-4CD7-8A23-4D9F8BCFD601%7D&file=Course%20Selection%20Advice%20-%20Year%203.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true), but keep in mind it contains feedback from students with a different background.

#### Older
Incredibly dull in my opinion. Coursework marked harshly. Would not do again. - JZ (2020/21)


One of the most interesting modules I’ve taken (personal opinion). Noteworthy topics include  linear optimisation (aside: this is a prereq for CO477 Optimisation and CO422 Computational Finance), game theory and minimax. Applications of knowledge in this course include optimisations in business (which business decision?) , finance (which investment?) and logistics (which route to take and where to build warehouses?). Worth noting that an ex-CEO of Singapore Airlines did a Masters in OR at Imperial (not sure if he applied it for route-planning, which--interestingly--appeared as a past year question in this module). First half (Casale -- No longer lecturing) is a tad bit slow (but some parts are heavy), and the second half (Misener) is well-paced and well-taught. I genuinely felt motivated to learn the material, and while there are some proofs to memorise, they aren’t heavy and come naturally once your understanding is sound. Coursework is doable, exam can be difficult (and contain some unseen material) but okay if you do the tutorial sheets. For EIE: No extra effort required. Slightly useful to go through some basic material in Logic to make sense of some logical statements (in Integer Programming), but not strictly required. For those considering taking EEE Maths for Signals and Systems: while both modules cover a lot of linear algebra, there isn’t much overlap except for some matrix fundamentals. I did not see taking both having an advantage/disadvantage. -LH (2019/20)

#### 2021/22
I’m ngl this was probably by far my favourite course from Autumn term, and arguably of my entire Imperial degree experience thus far (although still with time to go). While the material may seem abstract at first, Paul Kelly always manages to find a way to competently and clearly explain it in a way that makes you feel like you always knew the intuition behind it, and always presents real world examples underlying all the concepts we learned. I particularly enjoyed the sidechannels section of the course, as it overlapped CompArch with Security giving even more practical flavour. The coursework took a fair bit of time though this year, requiring quite a bit of exploration, you have two tasks which vary little in topic year on year but vary on code. The first task requires you to modify a simulator processor’s configuration (cache, exec units etc), in order to run a benchmark program with minimal energy consumption, the second task requires you to optimize code to hasten the exec time of a given piece of code, these courseworks took quite a lot of time investment but for rather low returns (only 10% each). Exam is pretty interesting in that you get a recent article on a new-ish processor specification about a month in advance to pore over, and you get asked questions based on this tying into the course, some may like it and others may not, but imo it was a pretty cool way to assess our understanding. The tutorials help reinforce understanding and have good discussion, size isn’t overtly large so everyone more or less gets a say, and when you’re lacking from knowledge from a given topic, the course textbook compensates for this and then some, it’s well supplied and well rounded. Honestly, if you’re EIE and you loved first year DECA, and you loved second year ISA&C, this module is an absolute no-brainer, take it. -Aryan

As others said, the CW is very lengthy so start your CW early! You have 2 separate reports to be completed with each having 2 weeks between the day they’re given and their deadline so make sure you put like 2-3 hours in per day straight from day 1 otherwise you end up having to cram towards the end like I did which resulted in me falling behind on content from other modules. -Nelson


#### Older
Honestly best course and best lecturer. Paul Kelly can seamlessly explain any complicated concept, and even though everything was remote, his lectures were great. In terms of the course content: when it comes to coursework, Computing students might enjoy it slightly more than EIE students, as most of it rotates around the high level perspective of computer architecture (in CW1 you optimize a processor’s configuration for a specific program, and in CW2 you optimize a C program for a specific processor). On the theory side (lectures), you touch on many complicated and fundamental computer architecture concepts to design a processor or optimize software when interacting with it, and you can use those in other modules or projects or even low-level / hardware interviews (especially EIE). For the exam, it’s different than the usual, you get a paper on a recent processor to study a month before and most exam questions are about applying the lectures content to that processor (even though the exam went okay-ish, I'd take that module again). A definite go if you are in EIE. EDIT: after the module, lookup pwn and hardware exploits from CTFs, you’ll know the hidden value of this module. I think there should be some merge with netsec in some way!  – Jaafar (2020/21)


Easily my favourite course from Autumn term. Paul Kelly is really passionate about the subject and always happy to answer questions. Coursework was way too time consuming though imo. Exam was actually quite interesting since it’s based around a research article. Even if you aren’t sure of an answer – if you explain your reasoning, he will generally give credit I think. For revision, a bunch of us got together and answered past paper questions using this year’s article (also, make sure you know the article really well) - JZ (2020/21)

#### 2021/22
Honestly a good course well worth taking if you’re fresh to this area, it gives you a rounded-base of competency in most of the useful and applied ML techniques and I hear has a lot of overlap with Spring Term’s Computer Vision. The Coursework took a little bit of time to do but ultimately was not that hard and with a good group you can bang out 90+% on both of them, as it’s just a matter of passing LabTS tests and having a legible report. Make sure to do that so you have a good cushion for the exam. Exam itself was not that bad this year, there are tiny curveballs here and there to compensate for the online setting and a reduced amount of recall questions to boot, and you’ll be asked predominantly questions based on the techniques you learnt which rely on quite simple applications of maths to do. If you want a decent grade while also learning stuff that’s more relevant than most, take it.  

(As an EIE student, be aware that by taking this module over the EE ML module – which seemed to just be entirely theoretical, you do forfeit taking the EE Deep Learning module in the Spring Term, which has a lot more application, as EE ML is the pre-req, don’t deep it though because DoC has a DL module in the 4th year so you’re calm) - Aryan

#### Older
Pretty well taught, good introduction. Get a good group for the coursework. If you’re EIE: do the DoC ML module if you want more practical stuff. Haven’t heard any good things about EEE ML course, which is also a lot more theoretical. - JZ (2019/20)

### Type Systems for Programming Languages
**Imperial Module Page: [here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/courses/60023/)**

#### Older
Agree with other comments that this is a good module, and that exam is very doable (if you put in effort and time to learn definitions, which are then used in derivations). While proofs are difficult and are bulk of the lectures to motivate applications and derivations, fortunately they are unexamined. Steffen is an amazing lecturer who loves the content and does his best to motivate you to appreciate type systems. While this course mostly deals with theoretical CS, its applications are not too far-fetched (e.g. implementing a type inference system (duh)). This course also serves as an ad for Steffen’s research topics, which he encourages students to consider by the end of the module. 


For EIE: DoC students will have an advantage of knowing lambda calculus and functional programming (though these aren’t strict prereqs and he will go through some relevant content). I found it helpful to go through Dr. John Wickerson’s lambda calculus lecture PDF: https://johnwickerson.github.io/talks/modcomp_lambda_2015.pdf, as well as a Haskell crash course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02_H3LjqMr8). It is possible to score well without revising these fundamentals though. Also, this course is (very slightly) helpful if you proceed to take HLP in Spring EEE, which uses F# (F# implements a Hindley-Milner type system, briefly covered in this module) -LH (2019/20) 

# Spring Term
## EE Modules
These modules are "coursework only", although many of them have some kind of test/quiz which counts towards your grade. Some coursework deadlines extend past the end of term (although ideally this shouldn't happen)
### Digital System Design

#### 2020/21
Really good module for developing an understanding of digital systems. It really helped to see just how much of a difference different design techniques made. The lectures were nice but seemed disconnected to the coursework imo. The coursework is time-consuming, and you need to be really on top of it as there will be loads of errors/bugs but as others have said, it’s very rewarding. - HH

Very time-consuming module. Definitely worth taking if you enjoyed Digital Electronics (with Professor Cheung) and Computer Architecture (Dr Clarke). As our DSD was done remotely, it was very hard to sort out debugging issues in a short amount of time, so be prepared to allocate a lot of time in the week for sorting out issues related to this module. GTAs are helpful but generally you do not get much time to speak with them. Dr Bouganis is very supportive and wants to help you out wherever he can, so be sure to ask him plenty of questions. His feedback for the 3 reports you are required to complete is also very detailed and helps you to learn. - Arijit (EEE)

### Advanced Signal Processing
**Imperial Module Page: [here](http://intranet.ee.ic.ac.uk/electricalengineering/eecourses_t4/course_content.asp?c=ELEC60002&s=J3#start)**

#### 2020/21

I would recommend this module only for those who are interested in signal processing and/or machine learning principles. Professor Mandic tries to make the lecture content interesting by including real-world examples, which I thought was a really good idea, however this content does not help at all with the 2 coursework assignments (Interim report due normally beginning of February and Final report (and code) due end of March).

One thing that I did not like about the Interim Report was the feedback I got back. For me, it did not give me any opportunities to learn, just ways to improve how my write my LaTeX code. However apparently the point of the Interim Report is to check whether you can design a report correctly, so bear that in mind. 

A word of warning for the final report, don’t expect to get any feedback for it until mid-August and the final grade till mid-September (for the 2020/21 year, MEng EEE/EIE students got letter grades back on the 15th of September). This feedback is not individual feedback. They send out an email to the whole ASP cohort which gives comments on how the group performed on the questions. The document can be found [here](https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/eeearn_ic_ac_uk/Documents/EE%20Resources/Textbooks/Year%203/Spring%20Term/Advanced%20Signal%20Processing/2021%20Group%20Feedback.docx?d=w28e0b3de94c447cd9d807976ea055a42&csf=1&web=1&e=1FT4c2)

In my opinion, GTA support for this module is quite poor compared to other 3rd year modules. The GTAs don’t show up until after you finish the Interim report, and when you ask them questions, they are unwilling to give answers, since the coursework has not been changed for several years. They are also in general very slow to respond to questions you post on the Q+A forums. Make sure that plenty of live sessions are organized, as they are happy to discuss the concepts in the lecture slides.

To wrap this up, I am only giving my experience after taking this module remotely. There is a lot of interesting content, but you must assess whether you want to put the effort into the two reports, based on how much feedback you will receive. Also make sure to contact the Head of Year and Director of Undergraduate Studies if feedback is not being released after an adequate amount of time.


The content is interesting for those who want to learn about real-world signal processing. However, the lecturer is not great at explaining and rarely bothers to answer questions over email or on Teams, which is so disappointing given the module was taught remotely. The GTA support is also bad because they often seem confused with the content themselves or will give vague or contradictory answers. Being passionate about signal processing, and asking higher years who took the module to compare plots is essential to doing well here. The CW is a 40 page report based on a long set of MATLAB exercises. You should start working on it ASAP and put in enough hours per week so you don’t end up scrambling in the end.


This module is awful. The content is interesting and the applications are useful, but the general feedback and support is terrible, and Mandic does a bad job of explaining some tough concepts. I wouldn’t recommend this course unless you have a serious interest in signal processing.

### Real-Time Digital Signal Processing

#### 2020/21
Short answer: don’t pick it unless there is a guarantee that the module was fixed. Nothing was done in C or assembly, only simulink. The lectures are very insightful about real-time DSP, yet most of the things were really improvised “on-the-go" style, especially that no solution was practically provided or possible for the largest coursework piece. Also no GTAs, so careful about support! (Although Adria is super kind and helpful, and answered all emails and questions throughout the term) Update: there will be a lot of improvements to the module next year, I believe it’s worth taking the module after aligning your expectations correctly.


Adria changed the content of the module significantly from 19/20, as everything was done with an under-powered TI board on Simulink. The lecturers give you some insight into practical DSP, but unless you took autumn-term DSP, you will not really know why you’re doing what you're doing. There was also no GTA support, so do try to confirm with him that he will actually have GTAs this year. On the bright side, Adria is supportive and willing to help students out. He was generous with how much time he devoted to support and answers emails quickly.

### High Level Programming
**Imperial Module Page: [here](http://intranet.ee.ic.ac.uk/electricalengineering/eecourses_t4/course_content.asp?c=ELEC60015&s=J3#start)**

#### 2020/21
Honestly I really enjoyed this module. Take it if you want to be a better programmer. You get out what you put in. F# is actually a really nice language to write in. Be aware that it is taught by Tom Clarke – you’ll know whether you like him or not from first year I reckon. Make sure you pick a good group – you'll be working a lot with your group and (unless it changes) you only pick half of the group. Also make sure you learn how to use Git beforehand! - JZ (EIE)


Some people say this module is tough. I honestly don’t think it is once you understand what functional programming is all about - so try to do that. F# is a very productive language to work with – it’s easy to debug, the code looks beautiful and it’s...well, high level. In comparison, I find C++ rather stressful as you need to keep track of the variables you’ve declared...F# is just functions! As JZ mentions, it can improve your ability as a programmer. I recommend checking the module out to see if it is for you. – Aaman (EIE)


The final coursework is kinda hard but really rewarding. Dr Tom Clarke is amazing but he’s still Dr Tom Clarke so it’s a really independent-learning module. It is still worth asking him or the GTAs for any help. Get the worksheets in early and try to ace the timed programming segment to put you in the best position for the final coursework. That one can be hard. The struggle of this project is picking a great group in my opinion as the workload is hefty at the end when you have a bunch of other deadlines but I was pretty lucky. If you like programming, it is really interesting learning functional programming so I would encourage taking it. - Simi


Functional programming moves basic programming ideas to the compiler. Overheads such as creating looping iterators are removed, so you don’t need (for int i=0; …..) anymore and can write more high-level, concise code. It is a great skill to have and even Python supports it. If you can follow the worksheets that Tom Clarke has prepared you are definitely set to ace the coursework. Coursework’s workload may not be evenly distributed among your team so make sure you voice out your concerns to the GTA’s or to Tom Clarke as early as possible if such situation is happening.

## 2020/21
Not that difficult I think. Get a good group that can work well with. Not that theoretical in my opinion. Veryyyy slow feedback. Slides weren’t that interesting tbh. JZ (EIE)


One of my favorite modules! You get to be creative and to work with your friends. If you have some other knowledge about websites, electronics, ML, you can show off and apply it on the projects. Important to pick a good team as it can really reduce your workload when it’s a good one. Stott is also a great lecturer and you can ask questions during labs, GTA will (generally) help. - MG 

### Deep Learning

#### 2020/21
This module is worth it if you want to find out about deep learning and how neural networks can be applied. I found the lectures to be nice, the GTAs were helpful and knowledgeable. However, I really enjoyed the Google Colab notebooks (in which you work with Keras models hands on). They really stimulate learning. Also...Colab Pro allows you to use Google Colab for longer time...but it’s perfectly possible to use the vanilla non-pro version if you manage your time well. In fact I kind of left tasks till the business end of term and I still got along fine without Pro. - Aaman (EIE)


Just use the Collab notebook, you can even get a headstart by cloning the previous year and doing most of the tasks+ report before they release it. TBF if you know a little about ML it’s a good way to get a good mark for people who are good at working autonomously – MG


Didn’t watch a single lecture and still got a decent grade. - Daryl


Not a very hard module if you can learn stuff yourself. You really don’t have to go to the lectures I think but it’s good to give your day routine. The Google Colab stuff was actually fun and machine learning helped. Use the feedback in the interim report because they like you to explain stuff in a certain way. Do not think you can leave the report last minute, I tried this and almost failed the module so make sure you leave time to run simulations, write up and format. Also split up the notebook running between mates and computers if you can. – Simi

Really good module, would highly recommend the module. The content is challenging but explained well, and Manikas and the GTAs provide excellent support. The coursework is on MATLAB, and whilst challenging is certainly doable. I would advise doing Manikas’ Comms module in Autumn term – its not necessary but will help a lot.

Quite hard and confusing (for me). It is getting harder year by year, maybe because it becomes open book these two years. Do take a look at the past papers for 2019-2020 and 2020-2021, it removes almost all simple and standard questions compared to previous years. The slides do not show every detail, and you need to search/ask by yourself. The tutorial sheets and slides only contain easy questions and provide simple examples, while the exam is way harder and complex.  It requires you to fully understand every aspect of the material. If you go and check the answers for previous years, some questions may contain 4-5 alternative answers, and no one know which is the correct one (for most of the time I would come up with a 6th answer). Also, for EIE, do teach yourself SQL before you choose this module, though it does not mention so.
